BlackJackers - Card counting application

The purpose of this application is to give Black Jack players an edge when playing on online
casinos with the method of card counting. Card counting is not illegal in Canada, but casinos
will ban you when they find out what you are doing (they are counting too).

Recommend to use at your own risk, the higher the count, the higher the chance of the dealer
busting. 

The application is not autonomous, the user must click each number that is played.

HOW TO USE

1. Run the script

2. Ensure the count is at 0

3. As cards are played click on the corresponding buttons:
	a) 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 - click button "2-6"
	b) 7, 8, and 9 - click button "7-9"
	c) 10, J, Q, K and A - click button "10 J Q K A"

4. When a new deck is played, click reset count.
